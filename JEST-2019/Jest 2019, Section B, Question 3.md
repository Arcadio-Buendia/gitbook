Q.Analyse the following op-amp circuit in the figure. Which one of the following statements is true about the output voltage $V_{out}$ when terminal 'C' is connected to point 'A' and then to point 'B'?
![](Jest%202019,%20Section%20B,%20Question%203.excalidraw.md)

a) $V_{out}=V_{in}$ and $V_{out}=-V_{in}$ when 'C' is connected to 'A' and 'B' respectively.
b) $V_{out}=-V_{in}$ and $V_{out}=V_{in}$ when 'C' is connected to 'A' and 'B' respectively.
c) $V_{out}=-V_{in}$ when 'C' is connected to either 'A' and 'B'. 
d) $V_{out}=V_{in}$ when 'C' is connected to either 'A' and 'B'. 

#### Understanding the Question
 - What are the signs of the output when 'C' is connected to either 'A' or 'B'
#### Designing an answer
 - When 'C' is connected to 'A'![](Jest%202019,%20Section%20B,%20Question%203,%20Figure%201.excalidraw.md)
	 - The non-inverting side recieves $V_{in}$ while there is a potential drop due to R in the inverting side making the output positive.
