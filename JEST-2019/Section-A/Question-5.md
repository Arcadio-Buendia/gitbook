Q. What is the binding energy of an electron in the ground state of $$He^+$$ ion?

##### Understanding the Question
 - Given an atom with 2 protons and  1 electron
 - The strength with which the electron is held, or the amount required to ionize an electron from the atom.

##### Designing an Answer
 - This is a hydrogen like atom
 - So [Bohr's theory](../../../physics/quantum/Bohr%20atom.md) can be applied to get the energy of $$n^{th}$$ state of a system with $$z$$ protons and 1 electron.
##### Solution
 - $$n=1$$ for ground state
 - $$z=2$$ for helium
 We know ![](Bohr%20atom#^e2d47a)
 $$$$\implies \boxed{E_1=-13.6\frac{2^2}{1^2}=54.4 eV}$$$$
