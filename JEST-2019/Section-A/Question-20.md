Q. Let A be a hermitian matrix, and C and D be the unitary matrices. which one of the following matrices is unitary?
$$$$(a)C^{-1}AC\hspace{2cm}
(b)C^{-1}DC\hspace{2cm}
(c)C^{-1}AD\hspace{2cm}
(d)A^{-1}CD$$$$

#### Solution:
 - We know ![](unitary%20matrix#^6330a8)
 - So $$\boxed{C^{-1}DC}$$ is unitary.
