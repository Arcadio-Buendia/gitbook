Q. A very long solenoid(axis along z direction) of n turns per unit length carries a current which increases linearly with time, $$i=Kt$$. What is the magnetic filed inside the solenoid at a given time t?

$$a) B=\mu_0nKt\hat z \hspace{8cm}  b)B=\mu_0nK\hat Z$$

$$c) B=\mu_0nKt(\hat x+\hat y) \hspace{6.7cm} d)B=\mu_0cnKt\hat z \hspace{3cm}$$

#### Designing an answer
 - We could use Ampere's circuital law to get the answer
 - We can also use ![](Biot-Savart's%20law.md#Biot-Savart's%20law) to narrow down our answer to the options.
#### solution
 - We now have $$B\propto I\implies B \propto Kt$$
 - $$B$$'s direction is given by cross product: $$\vec I\times\hat r$$'
 - The direction of $$B$$ from diagram is seen to be perpendicular to the $$x-y$$ plane. That is it's direction is $$\hat z$$
 - Since integration over loops shouldn't add a multiplicative constant
 - Our only option is $$\boxed{a)B=\mu_0nKt\hat z}$$
