Q. Consider a system of N distinguishable particles with two energy levels for each particle, a ground state with energy zero and an excited state with energy $$\epsilon>0$$. What is the average energy per particle as the system temperature T &rarr; $$\infty$$?

#### Understanding the Question:
 - N distinguishable particles &rarr; classical system
 - Energy level: 0,$$\epsilon$$
#### Designing an answer:
 - We must use Maxwell Boltzmann distribution here. 
 - Average energy per particle would be $$\sum E_i*p_i$$ from [here](probability#^34a06c)
 - The probability that a particle occupies a certain energy level is given by ![](maxwell-boltzmann%20energy%20distribution#^my-own-id)
#### Solution:
  - $$f_{MB}=A$$ for both states as $$T \to \infty$$
	  -	The probability for each state has to be $$\frac12$$
  - The average energy per particle is: $$$$\sum E_i*p_i=\epsilon*\frac12 +0*\frac12=\boxed{\frac\epsilon 2}$$$$
