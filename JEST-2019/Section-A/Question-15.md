Q. Two objects of unit mass are thrown vertically up with a velocity of $$1ms^{-1}$$ at latitudes $$45^oN$$ and $$45^oS$$. The angular velocity of the rotation of Earth is given to be $$7.29\times10^{-5}s^{-1}$$. In which direction will the objects deflect when they reach their highest point? Assume zero air resistance?
#### Understanding the Question
 ![](balls%20at%20latitude.excalidraw.md) 
  - The motion happens in a non-inertial frame and the coriolis force is present
 
 #### Designing an Answer
  - We can use the formula for the coriolis force as ![](rotating%20frames#^rotating-newton)
  - Where ![](rotating%20frames#^f65a72)
  - Our velocity vector $$\dot r$$ points straigt out of the page as shown in figure.
 #### Solution
  - The direction of of the coriolis force can be ascertained from $$\dot r\times\Omega$$.
  - The right hand thrumb rule can be used to get direction as the direction of thumb when fingers curl from one vector to other
  - We find that the balls will be $$\boxed{deflected\ west\ in\ both\ hemispheres}$$
