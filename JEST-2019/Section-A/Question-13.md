Q. A cyclotron can accelerate deuteron to 16 MeV . If the cyclotron is used to accelerate $$\alpha$$-particles, what will be their energy? Take the mass of deuteron to be twice the mass of proton  and mass of alpha particles to be four times the mass of protons.  
#### Understanding the Question
 - How does a cyclotron work?
	 - Assuming, it acclerates a particle to a certain speed
#### Designing an Answer
 - If the cyclotron can accelerate the deuteron to a speed $$v$$ then it must do so for the $$\alpha$$-particle as well. 
 - We need to find the energy of $$\alpha$$-particle at that speed.
 #### Solution
  - Finding velocity of deuteron:$$$$\frac12 (2p_m)v^2=16$$$$
  - For $$\alpha$$-particle: $$$$\frac12 (4p_m)v^2=E$$$$
  - Solving the equation: $$\boxed {E=32MeV}$$
