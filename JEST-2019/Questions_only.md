Consider three infinitely long, straight and coplanar wires which are placed parallel to each other. The distance between the adjacent wires is d . Each wire carries a current I in the same direction. Consider points on either side of the middle wire where the magnetic field vanishes. What is the distance of these points from the middle wire?
$$(a)\frac{2d}{3}\hspace{2cm} (b)\frac{2d}{\sqrt{3}}\hspace{2cm} (c)\frac{d}{3}\hspace{2cm} (d)\frac{d}{\sqrt{3}}$$

A rod consists of two equal sections of length l each with coefficient of thermal conductivity $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$, respectively. One end of the rod is kept at a fixed temperature $T_1$ and the other end at a temperature $T_2(T_1>T_2)$. If $\kappa_2=2\kappa_1$ then the temperature at the interface is:
$$(a)\frac{2T_1-T_2}{3} \hspace{2cm} (b)\frac{2T_1+T_2}{3}\hspace{2cm} (c)\frac{T_1+2T_2}{3}\hspace{2cm} (d)\frac{T_1-2T_2}{3}$$
